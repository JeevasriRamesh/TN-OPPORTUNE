TNOpportune: A Personalized Eligibility-Based Job and Scheme Finder for Tamil Nadu.

The TNOpportune is a full-stack web application developed to centralize government schemes and job opportunities into a single secure and user-friendly platform. It is designed to function like a real government website rather than a basic demo project. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a clean interface with search and filtering options such as category, age, gender, qualification, income, and community. The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js, and MongoDB is used as the database to store users, schemes, jobs, and application records dynamically.

The system includes a secure login mechanism with encrypted passwords and role-based access control. Guests can view schemes and jobs, registered users can log in and apply while tracking their applications, and the admin has special privileges to verify, approve, edit, or disable listings through a professional dashboard. The platform supports automatic updates from official sources, marks expired items, and ensures only verified content is published. With dynamic navigation, secure authentication, database integration, and administrative control, the project demonstrates a realistic and production-level government portal workflow.
